BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

NOTE: You need to use a recent version of Scala (at least 2.10.2) to compile ECALogic. Your Linux distribution may ship with an older version, so beware of this. When using sbt, it solves this problem for you by installing the correct version of Scala in a local folder.

The recommended way to distribute the command-line application to your users is by using Proguard.

==================
1) Create a "fat .jar" using Proguard.

When using plain "sbt package", a .jar file is created that does not contain the Scala library, forcing users to install the correct version of Scala (2.10.2 or better) to run it. This is not a good way to distribute the project to end-users. Instead, use sbt to create a proguarded .jar as follows:

From within sbt, run:

> proguard:proguard

The standalone .jar file created can be executed by using java -jar.

==================
2) Creating a sbt-launch application.

This creates a small .zip file (in target/) with a portable script/batch file that you can distribute to your users. On first execution, this downloads the relevant libraries and our application from a Maven repository.

To create, from within sbt, use:

> launcher:package

In case ECALogic is not available through the public Maven repository, you need to publish it to a local repository as well:

> publishLocal

The advantage of this is that users will always have a recent version; the disadvantage is a slightly slower startup time of the program.

==================
3) Running a web-interface

This is ideal for letting end-users experiment with the tool without actually having to install it. Note that some features may be disabled in the web-interfaace.

To build the webinterface as a .war file, from within sbt, run:

> package

The war file can easily be deployed to a webserver.

For a example how to deploy to cloudbees or other cloud services can be found in the Lift cookbook: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000030/ch10.html

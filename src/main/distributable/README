=============================================

ECALogic: a tool for performing energy consumption analysis.

Installation:

- Extract the binary distribution zip or tar archive.  
- Add <installation-folder>/bin to your PATH environment variable. (optional)

Usage:

  ecalogic [OPTIONS] file1.eca [[<alias>=]file2.ecm ...]

Functionality options:

  -t --terse                Give only a brief output of the analysis
  -I --import [<a>=]<qname> Load a component from the component classpath with optional alias.
  -h --help                 This friendly and extremely useful help message
  -P --fixPatience <n>      Number of iterations for finding fix-points (default: 10000)
  -e --entry <main>         Perform analysis on the given function (default: main)

If "<alias>=" is omitted for an explicitly loaded component, it is determined from the filename or class name instead.

Options controlling analysis:

  -tr --techReport          Use while loop as specified in the technical report
  -s  --sync                Synchronize all components to the global time
  -u  --update              Update component timestamps, even when the state did not change

The options -s or -u should give stricter bounds. -u is probably subsumed by -s, but since this is a research tool,
more analysis is needed.

=============================================
In detail:

If you specify components to be loaded on the commandline, they override import statements in the .eca file.


If you supply -u, there are two changes that deviate from the paper:

 1) A delta function always updates its timestamp, even if the state did not change.
 2) A delta function also takes into account the amount if time the component-function itself takes while calculating
    the new energy-aware component state.

This should usually result in tighter bounds, but might (in some cases) also do the opposite.


If you supply -s, the follow changes are applied:

 1) Before and after each control structure in your program, all components are updated to the new timestamp. This
    should produce much tighter bounds. We have not analysed whether -u -s has different behaviour from just -s.


If you supply -tr, the while-analysis as specified in the technical report is performed,
i.e. the first iteration of each While-loop is analysed separately.

Programs to be analyser have to written as .eca files. This is a simple WHILE-like language with arithmetic
expression, restricted while loops and simple Hoare-annotations:

    function doSomething(X, Y, Z)

      if X < Y + 3 or Y = Z then
        skip
      else
        X := X * 10
      end if

      SomeComponent::doSomething(Z)

      { T <- Z }               // annotation
      while X < 23 bound T do  // bound while loop
        X := X + 1
      end while

    end function

Functions can call each other, but recursion is not allowed.

Variables in ranking functions used in while-loop must always refer to function parameters, constants,
or be accompanied by an annotation.

eca-programs can import components using a 'import component' followed by a qualified component name,
which is looked up in the Java classpath.

Component models can be specified in .ecm files.

An example of an ecm component model is shown below:

    component Radio(active: 0..1)

        initial active := 1

        component function on uses 40 time 40 energy
            active := 1
        end function

        component function off uses 20 time 20 energy
            active := 0
        end function

        component function queue(X) uses 30 time 30 energy
        component function send uses 100 time 100 energy

        function phi := 2 + 200 * active

    end component

A component function is visible to the user of your component and is considered in the energy analysis. Other
functions are internal to the component. Every component needs to have a 'phi' function specifying the energy
consumption over time.

Component state variables (such as 'active' above) need to be specified in the component header. Initial values for
these are optional.

Alternatively, component models can be specified in Scala directly by inheriting from
nl.ru.cs.ecalogic.model.DSLModel or directly from the base class nl.ru.cs.ecalogic.model.ComponentModel.

DSLModel provides a small DSL in Scala to easily write component models without much knowledge of Scala. The
ComponentModel class can be inherited for full control over the process.
